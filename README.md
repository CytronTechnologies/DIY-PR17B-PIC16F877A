# Voice Recording and Playback: ISD1790
Sample source code for DIY PR17B. Project description : This PIC microcontroller based project uses PIC16F877A to interface with ISD1790 voice recording chip. It offers an interesting source to develop an audio recording and playing system. Now you can record any audio and play it back.Compatible with MPLAB IDE with HITECH C compiler, MPLABX with HITECH C compiler v9.83/v9.80 and XC8 compiler.

There is 3 folder which are Source code(.c), Sample code using MPLABX and sample code using MPLAB(Using MPLAB 8.6 And HiTech 9.80). Welcome to our tecnical forum for any inquiry. http://forum.cytron.com.my/
